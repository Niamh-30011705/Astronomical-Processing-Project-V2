# Astronomical-Processing-Project-V2
This project is a continuation of Astronomical Processing Project. This project is to demonstrate my programming knowledge by producing a program that will process astronomical data streamed from a local observatory. The continuous data represents the interaction of neutrinos with earth matter, which are amplified and stored in an array data structure for analysis. The demonstration of the final application will utilize simulated data. I will be making a prototype of a forms-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) application which displays the data in a list box and uses text boxes and buttons for processing.
